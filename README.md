# [@memkins](https://twitter.com/memkins) account on Twitter.

The goal of this channel is to repost funny memes and comics about Jenkins, while delivering best practices to end users.
Although this channel will include more sarcasm and self-criticism than the official channel, the plan is to keep it overall positive w.r.t Jenkins.
It will also remain within the [Jenkins Code of Conduct](jenkins.io/conduct) boundaries.
